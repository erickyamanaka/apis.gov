  You can discover government APIs published by numerous agencies within the federal ecosystem. You can search by keyword and get basic information about each API, such as the link to documentation and the point of contact for the API.
</p>
<p>You can also submit APIs to be  added to the registry.</p>

<h2>What APIs are in the registry?</h2>

  Additions to the registry will be largely automated (via scraping hosted apis.json files from agency websites and via form submissions) but always approved by a human reviewer.
