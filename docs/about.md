## What is this?
APIs.gov is API registry for US government APIs. It hosts a machine-readable of APIs published by US government agencies and provides a user interface for searching and discovering these APIs.

## What can I do here?
You can discover government APIs published by numerous agencies within the federal ecosystem. You can search by keyword and get basic information about each API, such as the link to documentation and the point of contact for the API.

You can also submit APIs to be  added to the registry.

## What APIs are in the registry?
Check them out <a href="/apis.gov/">here!</a> You can also find the machine-readable format <a href="/apis.json">here</a>.

## How do I submit an API to the registry?
Additions to the registry will be largely automated (via scraping hosted apis.json files from agency websites and via form submissions) but always approved by a human reviewer.
